# Blockchain-based ledger system

 ## Overview 
* This app is a development of a decentralized blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface which allows partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.  

## Methodology and Approach
  * Created a Record Data Class

  * Modified the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data

  * Added Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface

  * Tested the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records

## Summary of the blockchain-based ledger system functionality

  * System users in partner banks will be greeted with the following data input area on the web interface:

  * Upon entering values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then clicking  the "AddBlock" button, the user can generate the following pychain ledger of a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks:

  * Users shall verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu as follows:

  * Test the blockchain validation process by clicking the "Validate Chain" button on the web interface, which should return "true" if  the blockchain is valid as depicted below:
